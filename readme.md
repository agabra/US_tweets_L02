# Lab 2: Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization

In this lab, I collected data from twitter around the United States for two separate times on Friday 4/22/2022.
The first time was around 5:00 PM and the second time was around 8:00 PM. I wanted to 
see if the amount of tweets while decrease because that is usually when people start getting 
ready to go to bed and I was also curious if the words would be different.

For my observation, there was a slight decrease in the amount of tweets around the united states around 
8:00 PM. It was mostly in the populated area, like Seattle, Chicago, California and other places. This made 
me think that a lot of the twitter users are the younger generation and that is maybe why we did not see a 
bigger decrease in the amount of tweets.

For the words, I thought they were pretty similar since the words that were repeated the most were some of the 
most common words in the English language, like "Go, out, up, time, need, game, love, day". However, if you look 
closer there are some unique words that are not in both images. Like the word "night" is on the 8:00 PM picture but 
not on the 5:00 PM. This shows that there is a slight difference in words and I beleive that the tops words will stay 
being the top words because they are used in many sentences.# US_tweets
